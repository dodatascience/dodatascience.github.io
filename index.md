# Our Objectives
You can be fascinated by data science, but if you hate the day-to-day tasks and feelings that come with it, it will be very difficult to maintain your motivation.
For most people starting out, it may take months before you actually get to the “doing” phase of your education.

These are some of the tasks and feelings you will need to be comfortable with if you choose to pursue a career in data science:
Feelings:
The feeling of never being done with learning.
The feeling of being out of your depth/overwhelmed.
The feeling of failing many, many times to get one success.
The feeling of having something you spent weeks on, fail or be ignored.
